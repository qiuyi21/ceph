* In previous versions, if a client sent an op to the wrong OSD, the OSD
  would reply with ENXIO.  The rationale here is that the client or OSD is
  clearly buggy and we want to surface the error as clearly as possible.
  We now only send the ENXIO reply if the osd_enxio_on_misdirected_op option
  is enabled (it's off by default).  This means that a VM using librbd that
  previously would have gotten an EIO and gone read-only will now see a
  blocked/hung IO instead.
